# Netlify Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue: "Could not read package.json"

The error you're seeing indicates that Netlify cannot find the `package.json` file in your GitHub repository. This is a common issue when the repository structure doesn't match the expected layout.

## Root Cause Analysis

Based on the error logs:
```
npm error enoent Could not read package.json: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/opt/buildhome/repo/package.json'
```

This means the `package.json` file is either:
1. Not in the root directory of your GitHub repository
2. Missing from your GitHub repository entirely
3. The build process is looking in the wrong directory

## Quick Fix Solutions

### Solution 1: Verify Repository Structure

Check that your GitHub repository has this exact structure:

```
your-github-repo/
├── package.json              ← MUST be here (root level)
├── package-lock.json         ← MUST be here (root level)
├── netlify.toml             ← Configuration file
├── client/                  ← Frontend code
│   ├── index.html
│   └── src/
├── server/                  ← Backend code
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── routes.ts
├── shared/                  ← Shared types
│   └── schema.ts
└── ... other files
```

### Solution 2: Updated Netlify Configuration

I've updated the `netlify.toml` file to fix this issue:

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm install && npm run build"
  functions = "netlify/functions"
  publish = "dist"
  base = "."                   ← This ensures root directory

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"          ← Simplified configuration
```

### Solution 3: Manual Netlify Configuration

If the above doesn't work, manually configure in Netlify dashboard:

1. Go to your Netlify site settings
2. Navigate to "Build & deploy" → "Build settings"
3. Set these values:
   - **Base directory**: Leave empty or set to `.`
   - **Build command**: `npm install && npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`

## Step-by-Step Fix Process

### Step 1: Check Your Repository
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Verify `package.json` is visible in the root directory
3. If it's not there, you need to push the complete project structure

### Step 2: Re-deploy
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Navigate to your site
3. Go to "Deploys" tab
4. Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"

### Step 3: Monitor Build Logs
1. Watch the build process in real-time
2. Check for any new error messages
3. Verify the build command finds package.json

## Alternative: Manual File Upload

If GitHub integration continues to fail:

1. **Build Locally**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Manual Deploy**:
   - Zip the `dist` folder contents
   - Go to Netlify dashboard
   - Drag and drop the zip file to deploy manually

## Environment Variables Setup

After fixing the build issue, ensure these are set in Netlify:

```
DATABASE_URL=your_supabase_connection_string
SESSION_SECRET=your_32_character_random_string
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Expected Build Output

When working correctly, you should see:
```
4:24:01 PM: Installing npm packages using npm version 10.8.2
4:24:02 PM: npm install completed successfully
4:24:03 PM: Running build command: npm run build
4:24:05 PM: Build completed successfully
```

## Contact Points

If issues persist:
1. Check Netlify community forums
2. Verify your GitHub repository structure
3. Consider using Vercel as an alternative (already configured)

## Next Steps After Successful Deployment

1. Visit your deployed site URL
2. Test the contact form functionality
3. Access admin panel at `/admin/login`
4. Change default admin credentials (admin/admin123)
